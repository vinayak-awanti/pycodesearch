Python now gets the locale encoding with C code to initialize the encoding
of standard streams like sys.stdout. Moreover, the encoding is now
initialized to the Python codec name to get a normalized encoding name and
to ensure that the codec is loaded. The change avoids importing _bootlocale
and _locale modules at startup by default.
