Due to unexpected compatibility issues discovered during downstream beta
testing, reverted :issue:`29463`. ``docstring`` field is removed from Module,
ClassDef, FunctionDef, and AsyncFunctionDef ast nodes which was added in
3.7a1.  Docstring expression is restored as a first statement in their body.
Based on patch by Inada Naoki.
