:func:`shutil.copyfile`, :func:`shutil.copy`, :func:`shutil.copy2`,
:func:`shutil.copytree` and :func:`shutil.move` use platform-specific
fast-copy syscalls on Linux, Solaris and macOS in order to copy the file
more efficiently.
On Windows :func:`shutil.copyfile` uses a bigger default buffer size (1 MiB
instead of 16 KiB) and a :func:`memoryview`-based variant of
:func:`shutil.copyfileobj` is used.
The speedup for copying a 512MiB file is about +26% on Linux, +50% on macOS and
+40% on Windows. Also, much less CPU cycles are consumed.
