logging.Formatter enhancement - Ensure styles and fmt matches in
logging.Formatter - Added validate method in each format style class:
StrFormatStyle, PercentStyle, StringTemplateStyle. - This method is called
in the constructor of logging.Formatter class - Also re-raise the KeyError
in the format method of each style class, so it would a bit clear that it's
an error with the invalid format fields.
