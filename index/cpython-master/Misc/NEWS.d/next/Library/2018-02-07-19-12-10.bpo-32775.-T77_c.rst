:func:`fnmatch.translate()` no longer produces patterns which contain set
operations. Sets starting with '[' or containing '--', '&&', '~~' or '||'
will be interpreted differently in regular expressions in future versions.
Currently they emit warnings. fnmatch.translate() now avoids producing
patterns containing such sets by accident.
